# Session Handoff — Payroll Management System

Read this file first in any new session, alongside `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`. Together they should
be enough to resume correctly without re-deriving context from scratch — per
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s own "How to Resume This Project" section, the full read order is:
`docs/PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` → `docs/architecture/overview.md` → rest of `docs/architecture/*.md` →
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` → this file → `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.

## 1. Current repository status

- Branch: `main`
- **Latest committed commit: `e26fe8c`** — "Phase 2.5 Checkpoint 4: CNIC normalization,
  duplicate-check, and Reactivate workflow". Full lineage: `674ab04` (Phase 2's substantive build) →
  `89ac6ff` (Phase 2 UI/UX polish pass) → `11cdc9d` (Phase 2 checkpoint documentation) → `b7ba9cf`
  (pre-Phase-3 architecture review) → `74c124e` (further doc status update) → `0d9ea33`
  (Checkpoint 0) → `c60094c` (Checkpoint 1) → `70a45ad` (Checkpoint 2) → `b27f559` (Checkpoint 2 doc
  close) → `ed4ed1f` (**database-verification debt closed**, 2026-07-04) → `33f2b18` (Checkpoint 3) →
  `28d4192` (doc-only commit hash record) → **`e26fe8c` (Checkpoint 4, this session's substantive
  commit — a small follow-up doc-only commit closing this exact hash into the record may follow it;
  check `git log -1` if in doubt).**
- **Working tree is clean. Phase 2.5 Checkpoint 4 (CNIC normalization, duplicate-check, Reactivate
  workflow) is approved, committed, and verified** — typecheck/lint/build clean, 99/99 backend tests
  against live PostgreSQL, real-stack Playwright verification clean. **Phase 2.5 is now fully
  complete — all five checkpoints (0–4) done and committed.** Full detail in
  `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §1's Checkpoint 4 subsection. **Phase 3 has not been started and
  requires separate, explicit authorization before any architecture review or implementation
  begins** — not given as of this session.
- Checkpoint 2 shipped (prior session): `Employee.unitId` + composite FK against
  `ProjectUnit(id, siteId)`, the new append-only `EmployeeTransferHistory` table, migration
  `20260703140000_employee_unit_and_transfer_history`, `assertUnitBelongsToSite()`, `updateEmployee()`
  rewritten to detect a transfer and write the Employee update + `EmployeeTransferHistory` row +
  `employee.transferred` `AuditLog` entry atomically in one transaction (also fixing a pre-existing,
  unrelated atomicity gap in the ordinary `employee.updated` path — see §3 below), a new reusable
  `SiteUnitSelect` component wired into the Employee Registry's create/edit form, interim
  import/export unit handling (single-unit-per-site auto-resolve; full column remap is Checkpoint 3),
  new/updated backend tests, and a `pluralize()`-utility-reuse fix caught while writing an error
  message. **Do not begin Checkpoint 3 without first closing the database-verification debt below —
  this is now an explicit, mandatory gate, not a background item.**
- **Phase 2 is complete and committed. The pre-Phase-3 architecture review is complete and
  committed.** A full pre-Phase-3 architecture review produced six new business decisions (Project
  Unit model, Payroll Entry Work Lines, date display standard, a 10,000-employee performance floor, a
  CNIC duplicate-detection recommendation, and a deployment-model reaffirmation), all written into
  `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`,
  `docs/architecture/folder-structure.md`, `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `docs/design-system.md`,
  `docs/PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` (new Principle 10), and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (new Phase 2.5).
  **The CNIC recommendation is now a finalized decision, not pending** — see §3 below and
  `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 22. Full decision record: `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 items
  16–22.
- **Phase 2.5 is in progress.** Checkpoints 0–3 are complete (0–2 committed in prior sessions; the
  database-verification close and Checkpoint 3 — import/export remap to Project Units with
  three-layer Site/Unit validation — were both completed 2026-07-04, see §2's entries for that
  date). Checkpoint 4 (CNIC/Reactivate) remains, and its concrete implementation requires a
  design-approval gate before any code is written.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` (0 errors, same 3 pre-existing `react-refresh` warnings), and
  `npm run build` were all re-run at the end of this session after Checkpoint 2's code changes and
  are clean across all three workspaces. `backend/tests/date-utils.test.ts` and `rbac.test.ts` (no DB
  required) were run directly and pass (23/23 assertions); every updated/new DB-backed test file
  (`employees.test.ts`, `employees-import-export.test.ts`, `project-sites.test.ts`,
  `project-units.test.ts`) was confirmed to compile and execute correctly through `ts-jest`, failing
  only on the expected "no Postgres reachable" environment constraint — not a code defect. A final,
  whole-app Playwright pass (Employee Registry + Project Sites/Manage Units together) also ran clean
  with zero console errors.
- **The database-verification debt is CLOSED (2026-07-04).** Real PostgreSQL 18 was provisioned in
  the session sandbox (embedded-postgres npm binaries — no Docker/Homebrew needed; see
  `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §1's "Database verification" subsection for the recipe). All six
  pre-existing migrations applied to a completely fresh database without modification; the full
  backend suite passes **78/78**; the composite FK and Audit Log immutability were additionally
  verified at the raw-SQL level; a second fresh database replayed the whole chain to prove
  reproducibility; and a first-ever **real-stack Playwright E2E** (live browser → frontend →
  backend → PostgreSQL, no mocks) passed with zero console errors. Four real defects were found and
  fixed — see §2's 2026-07-04 entry and §3's new rules. The live DB is scratchpad-local and must be
  re-provisioned each session (fast: migrate deploy + seed).

## 2. What was completed today (2026-07-02)

**Morning: Phase 1 close-out and decision resolution**
- Resumed per `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s "How to Resume This Project"; verified branch/commit/
  clean tree; confirmed the repository matched the documentation exactly.
- Re-confirmed no Postgres is reachable in this environment (checked for Docker, Docker Compose,
  Podman, Homebrew, native `psql`/`pg_ctl`, Postgres.app — none present), and did not attempt to
  install one, per instruction.
- Resolved the Bank/AdjustmentType/CompanySettings Phase-1-vs-Phase-2 scope question with the user
  (ratified the existing `schema.prisma` narrowing) and the two Employee Registry §26 design
  assumptions (CNIC/employeeCode nullability, free-text designation/religion) — both updated in
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`/`docs/architecture/database-schema.md`.
- Obtained the user's **explicit conditional sign-off** on the Phase 1 review checkpoint and
  committed the close-out as `2e804d4`.

**Afternoon: Phase 2 implementation, in full**
- Built all five Phase 2 deliverables per `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: the master-data migration
  (`Bank`/`Employee`/`AdjustmentType`/`CompanySettings`), Project Sites
  CRUD, Employee Registry CRUD (C11 site-scoped RBAC, CNIC/employeeCode uniqueness, DOL-based
  leaving), Employee Registry CSV/Excel import/export against the official template, the Settings
  module (Company Details/My Profile/Theme), and User Management — backend + tests + frontend for
  each, in that order, verifying `typecheck`/`lint`/`build` after every module rather than only at
  the end. Full detail in `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §1.
- Added site-scoping boundary tests beyond the per-module basics, specifically covering the C11
  decision's "direct API call with a manipulated siteId" requirement, including an update-time
  site-change boundary case.
- Discovered and documented (did not silently work around) a gap: `StorageProvider`, called for in
  Phase 0's plan text, was never actually built in any prior session. Scoped Settings/My Profile to
  text fields only this session and flagged logo/avatar upload as blocked on this — see
  `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 4 for the resolution options.
  Also flagged (non-blocking) the Employee Registry import template's two redundant-looking column
  pairs as an assumption worth client confirmation — §3 item 5.
- Generated three static HTML prototypes under `docs/prototypes/` at meaningful UI milestones
  (Project Sites, Employee Registry, Settings+Users) per the user's standing instruction.
- Added new dependencies: `@radix-ui/react-dialog` (frontend, first Modal component); `exceljs`,
  `csv-parse`, `csv-stringify`, `multer` (backend, import/export).

**Evening: architectural review before the Phase 2 commit**
- Before committing, the user reviewed the Phase 2 work and identified that
  `ProjectSite.defaultBankId` (added during this session) was wrong for Broom Services' actual
  business model: Project Sites are physical work locations only; employees own their own payment
  method/bank account; Broom Services itself owns the company bank account(s) used as disbursement
  *source* accounts. Removed `defaultBankId` completely — schema, the hand-edited (never-applied)
  migration, shared Zod schema, backend service/routes, frontend form/table, HTML prototype, and
  `docs/architecture/database-schema.md`'s §7/§8/§21 text (with an explicit dated revision note,
  since that document is otherwise frozen). See `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 6 for the full
  reasoning.
- Performed a full architecture consistency review against the corrected business model and
  surfaced two further items *without* silently fixing them — `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 items
  7–8: (a) Broom Services' own disbursement source bank account(s) aren't modeled anywhere yet
  (matters for Phase 4, not Phase 2); (b) `ProjectSite` may be missing `address`/`client` fields per
  the user's own restated model, though site names already encode the client as free text so this
  may not be a real gap. Both presented to the user for a decision, not resolved.
- Confirmed the deployment model is unaffected: single-company-per-installation (the `CompanySettings`
  singleton, fixed-UUID pattern) with no `Tenant`/`Organization`/`Workspace`/`Company` abstraction
  anywhere in the codebase — nothing needed to change here, this was a confirmation, not a fix.
- Re-ran `typecheck`/`lint`/`build` after the correction; this file and `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`
  updated again to reflect the revised Phase 2 state. A commit is still pending explicit user
  approval, now for the corrected version of Phase 2.
- **This Phase 2 work was subsequently committed as `674ab04`** ("Phase 2: Project Sites, Employee
  Registry, Settings, User Management") — the commit approval referenced above was obtained and
  acted on; `674ab04` is HEAD as of the polish pass below.

**Later same day: Phase 2 UI/UX polish pass (explicitly not Phase 3)** — full detail in
`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`'s "Phase 2 UI/UX polish pass" subsection. Summary: fixed a global
`AppShell` scroll bug (blank space above the sidebar on overscroll), added a local-time-based
dashboard greeting, fixed an Employee Registry table header/value alignment mismatch, added
`ProjectSite.address` (a scoped, explicitly user-authorized exception to this pass's own
no-schema-changes rule — see `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 8 and
`docs/architecture/database-schema.md` §8's revision note), added a Company Logo placeholder section
to Settings and a matching logo slot on the login page (both UI-only, still blocked on
`StorageProvider`), improved Settings page spacing/hierarchy, standardized the seed script's company
name to "Broom Services Private Limited", and standardized `Button` height to match `Input`. A new
migration (`20260702165738_project_site_address`) was hand-written the same way as Phase 2's
migration, for the same reason (no Postgres reachable in this environment to run `prisma migrate
dev`) — validated via `prisma validate`/`format`, not yet applied to a live database.

**Still later same day: final visual consistency audit, then the Phase 2 checkpoint close.** The user
asked for one more pass — a full audit of every page/modal for spacing, alignment, typography,
padding, table headers, button heights, card widths, modal spacing, and responsive behavior — before
Phase 3. This is where Playwright-driven visual verification (real headless-Chromium rendering with
mocked API responses, screenshotted and measured, not just read as code) was actually used for the
first time in this project, and it caught two real, previously-undetected defects: a design-system-
contradicting label-casing inconsistency (8 call sites overriding the shared `Label` component to
`normal-case` for no discernible reason, contradicting `docs/design-system.md` §2.4's explicit
uppercase-filter-label rule) and a spacing value outside the documented scale (`gap-8`/`gap-9`,
self-introduced earlier the same pass). Both fixed. A suspected z-index stacking bug (dropdown menu
apparently rendering on top of a modal opened from it) was investigated with pixel-level sampling and
found to be a false alarm — a defensive fix was kept anyway (`Modal` now explicitly outranks
`DropdownMenuContent` in z-index) since it costs nothing and removes an implicit assumption. Full
detail in `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`'s "Final visual consistency audit" subsection.

**This ordering was revised 2026-07-03 (Phase 2.5, Checkpoint 1) — `DropdownMenuContent` now
outranks `Modal`, not the other way around.** Checkpoint 1's Manage Units panel was the first place
in the app a `DropdownMenu` opens *from inside* an already-open `Modal`, and at the old ordering
this was a confirmed, reproducible bug (not a false alarm this time): the open Modal's own overlay
permanently intercepted every click on the nested dropdown's menu items. See
`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`'s Checkpoint 1 entry for the full reasoning and the trade-off this
re-opens (a still-unconfirmed, purely cosmetic transition-overlap risk in the original direction).

The whole polish pass (layout fix, greeting, table alignment, Project Sites address, logo
placeholders, Settings layout, company name, button/input heights, plus this audit's two fixes) was
committed together as `89ac6ff` ("feat(ui): Phase 2 UI polish and UX improvements") after explicit
user approval — the commit message the user asked for at the start of the pass. The user then
explicitly stated **"Phase 2 is now complete"** and requested this formal checkpoint (this
documentation update), on the same conditional basis as Phase 1's closure (§4's DB-backed-
verification caveat carried forward as a tracked open item, not a blocker). **Phase 3 has not started
and must not begin without the user's explicit instruction next session.**

### What was completed this session (2026-07-03 to 2026-07-04)

A new session, picking up per "How to Resume This Project": confirmed branch/commit/clean tree
against `74c124e`, re-read the full doc set, and confirmed Phase 2 plus the pre-Phase-3 architecture
review were both genuinely complete and committed.

- **Approved the Phase 2.5 checkpoint breakdown** (Checkpoints 0–4) with five amendments: a
  Checkpoint 0 foundation step, three-layer Site/Unit import validation, dedicated employee transfer
  audit entries, a finalized CNIC/Reactivate policy (CNIC stays globally unique, no override,
  Reactivate for rehires), and the new `EmployeeTransferHistory` table — refined further to add
  `effectiveDate`/`remarks`/`transferredByUserId` and an explicit single-source-of-truth requirement
  for date formatting.
- **Checkpoint 0** — shared `formatDate()`/`parseDateInput()`/`toIsoDateOnly()` and a `DateInput`
  component; a full-codebase grep caught and fixed two pre-existing ad-hoc date-formatting call sites
  in the CSV/Excel export/import service. Committed as `0d9ea33`.
- **Checkpoint 1** — `ProjectUnit` as a dedicated master-data module, `ProjectSite.unitLabel`
  replacing `branchCode`, a "Manage Units" frontend panel. Playwright verification caught and fixed
  two real bugs: a nested-`Modal` Radix `aria-hidden` bug, and a `DropdownMenuContent`-behind-`Modal`
  z-index bug (this project's first `DropdownMenu`-inside-`Modal` usage). Committed as `c60094c`.
- **Checkpoint 2** — `Employee.unitId` + composite FK, `EmployeeTransferHistory`, atomic transfer
  writes (which also fixed a pre-existing, unrelated audit-logging atomicity gap in the ordinary
  employee-update path), a reusable `SiteUnitSelect` component, interim import/export unit handling.
  Also honored a Checkpoint-1 forward-reference by wiring up `deleteProjectUnit`'s previously-a-no-op
  delete guard. Committed in this session's final commit, together with this documentation update and
  refreshed HTML prototypes.
- **All four `docs/prototypes/*.html` files reviewed and updated** to reflect Checkpoints 0–2:
  Branch Code → Unit label throughout, a new "Manage Units panel" screen, `DD-MM-YYYY` date
  placeholders, a Site → Branch/Department cascading select in the Employee form. The two prototypes
  with nothing relevant to change (`phase1-preview.html`, `phase2-settings-users-preview.html`) were
  still reviewed individually and got a footer note confirming that review took place.
- **Full documentation consistency pass**: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`,
  `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` (this file), and `README.md` all updated to remove stale commit-hash
  references, "not yet committed" phrasing for now-committed work, and the outdated claim that
  Phase 2.5 was "architecture/documentation only."
- **The session was explicitly closed after Checkpoint 2** — the user's instruction was not to begin
  Checkpoint 3, and to make closing the database-verification debt the mandatory first task of the
  next session, ahead of any further implementation.

### What was completed this session (2026-07-04, evening): database-verification debt CLOSED

Executed exactly per §7 item 1 (as it stood): provisioned real PostgreSQL 18.4 in the sandbox
scratchpad via `@embedded-postgres/darwin-x64` (no Docker/Homebrew exists here; the binaries run
TCP-only on `localhost:5432` because the scratchpad path exceeds the Unix-socket length limit),
created the `payroll`/`payroll_dev` role/database matching `backend/.env.example`, and ran the full
sequence: `migrate deploy` (all six migrations applied to a fresh DB, unmodified, first try) → seed
(run twice — idempotency confirmed live) → full test suite.

**The first live run failed and surfaced four real defects, all fixed the same session** (full
detail: `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §1 "Database verification"):
1. The Audit Log immutability trigger blocked the FK's own `ON DELETE SET NULL` — any `User` with
   audit history was undeletable, contradicting `database-schema.md` §16. Fixed by a new migration,
   `20260704180000_audit_log_allow_fk_actor_set_null` (permits exactly that one column transition,
   rejects everything else); dated revision notes added to `database-schema.md` §16 and
   `data-and-storage.md` §3.
2. Every `Employee` date write 500'd against real Postgres (Prisma `@db.Date` rejects the bare
   `YYYY-MM-DD` strings the Zod schemas produce) — create-with-DOB, mark-as-left, transfer
   `effectiveDate`, and import DOB/DOJ/DOL were all affected. Fixed via a new shared
   `isoDateToUtcDate()` in `shared/src/lib/date.ts`, applied at every Prisma date-write boundary.
3. `cleanTestData()` deleted AuditLog rows — rejected by the project's own trigger. Tests no longer
   delete audit rows (assertions were already entity-scoped); `EmployeeTransferHistory` cleanup was
   added in FK-safe order (its `RESTRICT` FKs otherwise block employee/user cleanup).
4. The login rate limiter (10/IP/15 min) tripped under one-login-per-test; relaxed to 1000 under
   `NODE_ENV=test` only — production limit unchanged.

After the fixes: **78/78 tests, 10/10 suites, green**; a second fresh database replayed all seven
migrations + seed + suite from zero; `prisma migrate diff` against a real shadow DB shows no drift;
raw-SQL probes confirmed the composite FK rejects cross-site pairs at the database level and the
audit trigger still rejects ordinary UPDATE/DELETE. Then typecheck/lint/build (all clean; frontend
`.tsbuildinfo` cleared first per §3's standing lesson) and a real-stack Playwright E2E — seeded-admin
login, site + two units created, employee created **with a DOB** (exercising fix 2 end to end), DOB
round-tripping as `15-03-1990`, same-site transfer writing its `EmployeeTransferHistory` row and
`employee.transferred` audit entry — zero console errors. E2E fixtures were cleaned from the dev DB
afterward (audit rows remain, by design). **Phase 1's five open DB-backed checklist items and
Phase 2's one are now genuinely closed — see §5/§6.**

### What was completed this session (2026-07-04, evening, continued): Checkpoint 3

Built immediately after the database verification closed, per the session plan — the first
checkpoint in this project developed with its DB-backed tests actually running. Full detail:
`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §1's Checkpoint 3 subsection; plan text updated in
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Checkpoint 3 marked COMPLETE with the as-built mapping).

- **Export**: `Area`/`Area/Location` → the employee's `ProjectUnit.name` (documented aliases);
  `Branch Code` → `ProjectUnit.code`. The template's mapping comment is now a finalized decision,
  resolving `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 5 (subject to one client sanity-check).
- **Import**: `resolveRowUnit()` resolves a row's unit within its named site by code, then name,
  case-insensitively; all provided columns must agree; a row naming no unit is a per-row error —
  Checkpoint 2's interim single-unit auto-resolution is gone. Error messages use the site's own
  `unitLabel` via `pluralize()`.
- **Three-layer validation**: (1) `resolveRowUnit()` explicitly rejects a unit that exists under a
  *different* site, naming the mismatch; (2) `assertUnitBelongsToSite()` — now exported — is
  re-asserted before every import write; (3) the composite FK backstops, now with its own raw-write
  test. Each layer has a test proving it catches the violation alone.
- **Import-driven transfers are real transfers**: `updateEmployee()`'s transfer block was extracted
  into a shared `recordEmployeeTransfer()` (single implementation of the history-row +
  `employee.transferred`-entry invariant); the import path calls it atomically with the row update
  whenever a row changes an existing employee's site/unit (reason: "Employee Registry import").
  `importEmployees()` now takes `RequestMeta`. The one-summary-`employee.import`-entry design is
  unchanged for non-transfer rows.
- **88/88 tests against live PostgreSQL**; typecheck/lint/build clean; real-stack Playwright pass
  drove an actual CSV upload through the UI (2 created, 1 cross-site row skipped with the exact
  per-row reason shown in the Import Results modal; units verified via the edit form; zero console
  errors). Prototypes reviewed — none depict import contents, none changed.

## 3. What must not be changed without approval

- Anything in `docs/architecture/*.md` or `docs/PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` — the architecture is
  explicitly frozen (see `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s opening section). Any implementation detail
  that appears to contradict these documents must be raised, not silently reinterpreted.
- The phase ordering and review checkpoints in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (🛑 after Phase 1,
  Phase 3, Phase 5, Phase 6, Phase 9) — these are explicit stop-and-approve gates, not suggestions.
- The Phase 1 Prisma schema's table scope (`Role`/`Permission`/`RolePermission`/`User`/
  `ProjectSite`(minimal)/`UserSiteAssignment`/`AuditLog`) is now the **confirmed, permanent** Phase 1
  scope — resolved 2026-07-02, see `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3.1. `Bank`/`AdjustmentType`/
  `CompanySettings` belong to Phase 2 per the now-updated `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. Do not
  re-litigate this without a new explicit request.
- Audit Log immutability: no application code path should ever add an update/delete export from
  `audit-log.service.ts`, and the database trigger (originally
  `20260701164509_audit_log_immutability`, amended by
  `20260704180000_audit_log_allow_fk_actor_set_null`) must never be dropped or worked around.
  **The 2026-07-04 amendment is not a weakening**: it permits exactly one UPDATE shape — the
  `actorUserId` NOT NULL → NULL transition the FK's documented `ON DELETE SET NULL` action produces
  (`database-schema.md` §16's revision note) — and still rejects every other UPDATE and all DELETEs,
  verified live. Do not widen it further.
- **New rule (2026-07-04): every Prisma write to a `@db.Date` column goes through
  `isoDateToUtcDate()`** (`shared/src/lib/date.ts`) — Prisma rejects the bare `YYYY-MM-DD` strings
  the Zod schemas validate, and this was a real, live-DB-only 500 on every Employee date write.
  When adding any new date field (Phase 3's cycles, Phase 4's advances `dateGiven`, etc.), convert
  at the write boundary; grep for unconverted writes before calling the work done.
- Existing migrations (`20260701164444_init`, `20260701164509_audit_log_immutability`,
  `20260702084133_phase2_master_data`, `20260702165738_project_site_address`,
  `20260703100000_project_units`, `20260703140000_employee_unit_and_transfer_history`,
  `20260704180000_audit_log_allow_fk_actor_set_null`) should not be edited in
  place once applied anywhere beyond a fresh local dev database — per Principle 8 (additive-first
  schema evolution), later changes are new migrations, not edits to these. All seven are now
  verified against real PostgreSQL (2026-07-04).
- The C11 decision (Payroll Staff fully site-scoped on Employee Registry view/edit/create, no
  exceptions) is enforced via `assertSiteAccess()` in
  `backend/src/modules/employees/employees.service.ts` on every read/write path, including the
  site-change case on update and the import path. Do not add a code path that trusts a
  client-supplied `siteId` without this check.
- The `StorageProvider` gap (`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 4) is a known, flagged deviation
  from the frozen Phase 0 plan — do not silently build an ad-hoc file-upload mechanism to route
  around it (e.g. a one-off multer-to-disk handler for the logo). **Confirmed 2026-07-02: deferred
  until before Phase 5**, not Phase 3 or Phase 4 — do not add file upload UI before then without
  building `StorageProvider` first. **New consideration, confirmed 2026-07-02** (`docs/PROJECT_
  PROGRESS.md` §3 item 13): design it for portability to whatever hosting a given customer provides —
  the deployment model remains single-company-per-installation (no multi-tenancy), but is not assumed
  to run on one specific hosting platform.
- **New, permanent process rule, added 2026-07-02**: every future phase's Definition of Done includes
  Playwright-driven visual verification (real headless-browser rendering + screenshots, mocked API
  data where no live backend/DB is available) as a mandatory step, in this order: typecheck → lint →
  build → Playwright visual verification → documentation update → git checkpoint. This is not optional
  polish — it caught real defects in the Phase 2 UI polish pass that static checks alone missed (see
  §2's final entry). Do not skip it for a future phase's frontend work on the assumption that
  typecheck/lint/build passing is sufficient.
- **New 2026-07-03, final architecture decisions — do not re-litigate:**
  - `ProjectSite` no longer owns a Branch Code or Department; `ProjectUnit` (a new, dedicated
    master-data module, not folded into Project Sites) is the operational sub-division an employee is
    deputed to. Internally generic, always displayed via that site's own `unitLabel` terminology.
  - **Explicit business rule, not merely a schema implication:** a `PayrollEntryWorkLine` may only
    reference a `ProjectUnit` belonging to the same `ProjectSite` as its parent `PayrollEntry` — an
    employee's Work Lines can never span more than one Project Site within a single cycle. Enforced
    at **two** independent layers, both required, neither a substitute for the other: a
    database-level **composite foreign key** (`(unitId, siteId) → ProjectUnit(id, siteId)`) and
    application-layer validation. `Employee.unitId` is paired with `Employee.siteId` the same way.
    Do not simplify either to a plain FK.
  - **Every `PayrollEntry` always has at least one `PayrollEntryWorkLine` — never optional, never
    zero.** This was an explicit simplification the user requested over an earlier "optional split"
    design specifically to keep `calcNet` to one calculation path. Do not reintroduce a
    split/non-split branch.
  - **No cross-site editing exception of any kind for a multi-unit employee.** Payroll Staff remain
    scoped to their assigned Project Sites only; multi-unit splitting is always intra-site (a
    `ProjectUnit` belongs to exactly one `ProjectSite`), which is precisely what makes this possible
    without a new RBAC concept. Do not add one.
  - Every user-facing date renders as `DD-MM-YYYY`; internal storage/API stay ISO. This is
    `docs/design-system.md` §4, a permanent UI standard, not a suggestion.
  - `docs/PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` Principle 10: the system must comfortably support **at least 10,000
    employees**. This is a design floor to weigh in every future phase, not a Phase 9 concern —
    Principle 4 (never sacrifice correctness for performance) is explicitly not in tension with it.
  - **CNIC duplicate handling is now finalized (2026-07-03, session 2) — no longer pending.** CNIC
    stays globally unique with no override mechanism; duplicate `Employee` records are never
    permitted; rehires go exclusively through a new Reactivate Employee action that updates the
    existing row in place. See `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` §26 item 6 (rewritten as a final
    decision) and `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 22. **Per standing instruction, the concrete
    implementation (exact endpoint shapes, fields touched, audit contents) still gets presented for
    approval before Checkpoint 4's code is written** — the policy is settled, the implementation still
    gets a design-review gate.
  - **`EmployeeTransferHistory`** (new table, `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` §8b) — one row
    per Employee site/unit transfer (`effectiveDate`, `transferredByUserId`, optional `reason`/
    `remarks`, `createdAt`), append-only except by direct database intervention, no UI in Phase 2.5.
    Employee transfers also write a dedicated `employee.transferred` `AuditLog` entry, not the generic
    `employee.updated` entry. Do not fold these into a generic update path.
  - A new **Phase 2.5** (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) sits between Phase 2 and Phase 3, now broken
    into five explicit, individually-gated checkpoints (0–4). **Checkpoints 0, 1, and 2 are all
    committed; Checkpoints 3–4 have not started**, and won't until the database-verification debt
    (§1 above) closes out. Phase 3 depends on it (specifically, `PayrollEntryWorkLine.unitId` cannot
    exist without `ProjectUnit`, built in Checkpoint 1).
  - **`ProjectUnit` now exists in the schema and is queryable** (Checkpoint 1,
    `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`, migration `20260703100000_project_units`) — nested under a
    Project Site, CRUD via the dedicated `project-units` module
    (`backend/src/modules/project-units/`), mounted at `/api/v1/sites/:siteId/units` (list/create,
    `requireSiteAccess`-gated) and `/api/v1/units/:id` (update/delete, `sites:manage`-gated).
    `ProjectSite.branchCode` no longer exists anywhere in the codebase — it is `unitLabel` now.
    `deleteProjectSite` blocks on referencing `ProjectUnit` rows in addition to `Employee` rows.
    **`Employee.unitId` still does not exist** (Checkpoint 2) — `deleteProjectUnit`'s guard is
    therefore currently a no-op in practice (nothing references a unit yet) and is explicitly flagged
    as such in its own code comment; do not mistake this for a finished guard.
  - **`DropdownMenuContent`'s z-index was raised above `Modal`'s (`z-[70]` vs. `z-[60]`), reversing
    the 2026-07-02 Phase 2 polish-audit ordering** (`frontend/src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`,
    `modal.tsx`). Checkpoint 1's Manage Units panel was the first place in the app a `DropdownMenu`
    opens *from inside* an already-open `Modal`; at the old ordering this was a **confirmed,
    reproducible bug** (not the "false alarm" the 2026-07-02 audit found in the other direction) — the
    open Modal's own overlay permanently intercepted every click on the nested dropdown, verified via
    Playwright to persist indefinitely, not just during a transition. This re-opens a still-unconfirmed,
    purely cosmetic risk in the original direction (a dropdown closing at the same moment a new Modal
    opens from it could theoretically render above that new Modal during the fade transition) — judged
    an acceptable trade-off since that risk was never confirmed as a real bug, while the one just fixed
    was. Do not revert this ordering without re-verifying the Manage Units panel (or any future
    dropdown-inside-modal usage) still works.
  - **`Employee.unitId` now exists and is required** (Checkpoint 2, migration
    `20260703140000_employee_unit_and_transfer_history`), composite-FK'd against
    `ProjectUnit(id, siteId)`. Every place that creates an `Employee` — the API, the CSV/Excel
    importer, and every test fixture — must supply a valid `unitId` belonging to the same site.
    `deleteProjectUnit`'s delete guard (Checkpoint 1, previously a documented no-op) is **now wired
    up** to block deletion while any `Employee.unitId` references the unit, honoring the forward
    reference left in that function's own Checkpoint 1 code comment — the `PayrollEntryWorkLine`
    half of this guard still belongs here once Phase 3 adds that table.
  - **`EmployeeTransferHistory` exists and is written to** whenever an Employee edit changes
    `siteId`/`unitId`, in the same transaction as the Employee update and a dedicated
    `employee.transferred` `AuditLog` entry (never the generic `employee.updated` entry for that
    specific change — other fields changed in the same request still get the generic entry). No UI
    consumes this table yet, per the original design.
  - **A pre-existing atomicity gap, unrelated to the new transfer logic, was found and fixed while
    implementing Checkpoint 2's explicit "atomic in a single transaction" requirement**: before this
    checkpoint, `employees.routes.ts`'s PATCH handler logged the generic `employee.updated` audit
    entry itself, *after* `updateEmployee()` returned — not in the same database transaction as the
    `Employee` row update, a real (if narrow) Principle 3 violation. Fixed by moving all audit
    logging for employee updates inside `updateEmployee()`'s own `prisma.$transaction(...)`. This
    wasn't asked for directly, but was necessary to make the transfer case genuinely atomic, and the
    fix applies to the ordinary update path too, not just the new one.
  - **Lesson learned, worth repeating for future sessions**: a stale `tsc -b` incremental cache
    (`frontend/dist-types-app/*.tsbuildinfo`) briefly reported a clean frontend typecheck despite a
    real, missing-`unitId` type error in `employees-page.tsx` — caught only because the clean result
    looked suspicious given that file hadn't been touched yet. **Whenever `@payroll/shared` changes,
    clear frontend's `.tsbuildinfo` files before trusting `npm run typecheck --workspace frontend`.**

## 4. Current frozen architecture (reference index)

- `docs/PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md` — **10 standing principles as of 2026-07-03** (e.g. Payroll Entry as
  single source of truth, additive-first migrations, insert-only Audit Log, and the new Principle 10:
  a 10,000-employee performance/scale design floor).
- `docs/architecture/overview.md` — the load-bearing data path: Employee Registry/Project Units →
  Payroll Entry (+ Payroll Entry Work Lines) → Payroll Processing → Release → Bank Sheets/Cash
  Receiving, with Corrections/Balance Adjustments as the highest-risk branch. Major Modules table now
  includes **Project Units** as its own module.
- `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` — **full 20-table schema as of 2026-07-03** (18 original +
  `ProjectUnit`, §8a, + `PayrollEntryWorkLine`, §12a; Phase 1 + Phase 2 together implement a subset of
  it; see §1 of `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`). §26 item 6 (new) holds the CNIC duplicate-detection
  recommendation still pending final sign-off.
- `docs/architecture/authentication.md` — session-based auth, CSRF double-submit, RBAC +
  site-scoping as independent middleware layers. **Unaffected by 2026-07-03's changes** — multi-unit
  attendance splitting is always intra-site, so no unit-level RBAC concept was introduced.
- `docs/architecture/post-release-corrections.md` — the baseline-reconstruction/replay algorithm,
  deliberately scheduled late (Phase 6) per the plan.
- `docs/architecture/data-and-storage.md` — `StorageProvider` abstraction, Finalize Cycle
  precondition, Backup Package versioning.
- `docs/design-system.md` — tokens (color/type/spacing/radius), layout patterns, the shared component
  inventory the frontend must reuse rather than re-implement per page, and, **as of 2026-07-03, §4's
  `DD-MM-YYYY` date-display convention** (alongside the existing `en-US` number-format convention).

## 5. Phase 1 completion checklist

Per `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s Phase 1 Definition of Done:

- [x] Migration applies cleanly to an empty database — **verified live 2026-07-04** (fresh
      PostgreSQL 18, `migrate deploy`, unmodified, twice — second fresh DB replay included)
- [x] **Seed script confirmed idempotent against a live database** — verified 2026-07-04 (run twice)
- [x] **Scripted login as the seeded Master Admin succeeds** — verified 2026-07-04 (`auth.test.ts`
      live, plus a real-browser login in the Playwright E2E)
- [x] **Scripted attempt to call a protected route without a session fails with 401** — verified
      2026-07-04 (`auth.test.ts` live)
- [x] **Scripted attempt to update or delete an audit log row fails at the database level** —
      verified 2026-07-04 (`audit-log.test.ts` live, plus an independent raw-SQL probe)
- [x] **CSRF-missing requests to state-changing routes are rejected** — verified 2026-07-04
      (`auth.test.ts` live)
- [x] RBAC middleware unit tests (no DB required) — passing
- [x] `npm run typecheck` clean
- [x] `npm run lint` clean (0 errors)
- [x] **🛑 Review-checkpoint sign-off — obtained 2026-07-02 (conditional at the time).** The
      condition — DB-backed evidence — was fully discharged 2026-07-04.

**Bottom line: Phase 1 is closed, unconditionally, as of 2026-07-04.**

## 6. Phase 2 completion status

**Phase 2 is CLOSED (conditional), 2026-07-02** — same conditional basis as Phase 1 (code-complete +
statically verified + explicit user sign-off, with DB-backed evidence carried forward as a tracked
open item, not a blocker):

- [x] Master-data migration (`Bank`/`Employee`/`AdjustmentType`/`CompanySettings`) written and
      validated (`prisma validate`/`generate`/`format`); *not yet applied to a live database*.
      (`ProjectSite.defaultBankId` was added, then removed the same session after architectural
      review — see §2 "Evening" and `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 6.)
- [x] Seed script extended (banks, adjustment types, company settings placeholder) — idempotent by
      construction (upserts throughout, matching Phase 1's pattern); *not yet run against a live
      database*.
- [x] Project Sites, Employee Registry, Settings, User Management: all built, backend + frontend.
- [x] Employee Registry CSV/Excel import/export against the official template.
- [x] Site-scoping boundary tests written, covering the C11 decision via direct API calls with a
      manipulated `siteId` (not just the intended UI path) — *not yet executed against a live
      database*.
- [x] `npm run typecheck` clean (all three workspaces).
- [x] `npm run lint` clean (0 errors, same 2 pre-existing warnings as Phase 1).
- [x] `npm run build` clean (backend + frontend production builds).
- [x] **Master Admin can create a Payroll Staff user, assign sites, and confirm that user's session
      genuinely cannot see or touch employees/sites outside that assignment** (the Phase 2
      Definition of Done, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) — **verified live 2026-07-04**:
      `users.test.ts` + the C11 boundary tests in `employees.test.ts`/`employees-import-export.test.ts`
      all passing against real PostgreSQL, including the manipulated-`siteId` direct-API cases.
- [x] Phase 2 UI/UX polish pass + final visual consistency audit (Playwright-verified) — see §2.
- [x] **🛑 Phase 2 review checkpoint sign-off — CONDITIONAL, obtained 2026-07-02.** The user explicitly
      stated "Phase 2 is now complete" and requested this checkpoint. Phase 2 has no explicit 🛑 gate
      in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (unlike Phase 1/3/5/6/9), but per this project's established
      practice, an explicit sign-off was still obtained before Phase 3 — on the same conditional basis
      as Phase 1's: the one DB-backed item directly above remains open, not re-litigated.

**Bottom line: Phase 2 is closed, unconditionally, as of 2026-07-04** — its one outstanding
DB-backed item was verified against live PostgreSQL, same as Phase 1's five.

## 7. Next steps, in order

**Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 2.5 are all closed with full DB-backed evidence — see §1/§2.
Checkpoint 4 (the last of Phase 2.5's five checkpoints) was approved and committed this session
(`e26fe8c`, 2026-07-05). Phase 2.5 is fully complete.**

1. **Per session, re-provision the local database before running DB-backed tests** — the Postgres
   instance lives in the sandbox scratchpad and does not survive between sessions. Recipe: install
   `@embedded-postgres/darwin-x64` in the scratchpad, hydrate its symlinks, `initdb -U postgres -A
   trust`, start with `-c unix_socket_directories=''` (TCP only), create role `payroll` (password
   `payroll_dev_password`) and database `payroll_dev`, then `cp backend/.env.example backend/.env`,
   `npx prisma migrate deploy`, seed, test. Full detail: `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §1's "Database
   verification" subsection.
2. **Phase 3 (Payroll Entry & Payroll Processing) is next** — `PayrollEntryWorkLine.unitId`
   composite-FKing against `ProjectUnit` the same way `Employee.unitId` does (Checkpoint 2), now
   unblocked since Phase 2.5 is closed. **Requires separate, explicit authorization to start** —
   not given this session. Do not begin the pre-Phase-3 architecture review or write any Phase 3
   code without it.
3. Build `StorageProvider` (`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 4) — confirmed deferred until before
   Phase 5, not scheduled into Phase 2.5, 3, or 4. Design for hosting portability (§3 item 13).
4. Decide how Broom Services' own disbursement source bank account(s) should be modeled
   (`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 7) — before Phase 4 schema work begins.
5. Confirm the two still-open design assumptions from `docs/architecture/database-schema.md` §26:
   calendar-month-only cycles before Phase 3, at-most-one-`ACTIVE`-`Advance`-per-type before Phase 4.
6. Optionally confirm the Employee Registry import template's redundant-column interpretation with the
   client (`docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 5) — likely resolved as a side effect of Checkpoint 3's
   `ProjectUnit` remap, but worth an explicit client confirmation once that lands.
7. When explicitly instructed to begin Phase 3 (Payroll Entry & Payroll Processing) — `calcNet` over
   Work Lines, the Payroll Entry grid at a 10,000-employee design floor (Principle 10), optimistic
   locking, the largest single phase in the plan — its Definition of Done now includes Playwright-
   driven visual verification and a Principle-10 performance review as mandatory steps (§3's new
   process rules, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s "Definition of Done — Generic Criteria"), not just
   typecheck/lint/build.

## 8. Risks and assumptions

- **Resolved 2026-07-04 — migrations verified for real.** The long-standing assumption that the
  hand-written/`migrate diff`-generated migrations would apply cleanly was tested and held: all six
  applied to a completely fresh PostgreSQL 18 database unmodified, first try. The companion risk
  ("if the DB-backed tests fail, the fix may touch committed files") also materialized exactly as
  anticipated and was handled: four real defects were found and fixed (see §2's 2026-07-04 entry),
  one of them via a new migration — existing migrations were not edited.
- **Resolved**: the Bank/AdjustmentType/CompanySettings scope question, the two Employee Registry
  §26 items, the `ProjectSite.defaultBankId` removal, the `StorageProvider` deferral timing (confirmed:
  before Phase 5), `ProjectSite.address` (added, scoped exception), the company name ("Broom Services
  Private Limited"), and the deployment-portability nuance (single-company, but not
  hosting-provider-specific) — see `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3.
- **Still unresolved, carried forward**: the import-template redundant-column assumption (§3 item 5,
  likely resolved as a side effect of Checkpoint 3's `ProjectUnit` remap but not yet confirmed with
  the client), Broom Services' own disbursement source account modeling (§3 item 7, including its two
  sub-questions — needed before Phase 4 schema work), and the two open `database-schema.md` §26
  design assumptions (calendar-month-only cycles, at-most-one-`ACTIVE`-`Advance`-per-type). **The
  CNIC duplicate-handling decision (§26 item 6) is no longer on this list — it was finalized
  2026-07-03/04**: CNIC stays globally unique with no override, and rehires go through a Reactivate
  action — see `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` §3 item 22. Only the concrete Checkpoint 4 implementation
  still needs a separate design-approval gate, not the policy itself.
- **Assumption, flagged for revisit (2026-07-03)**: gross pay does not vary by Project Unit — verified
  against `reference/PROJECT_SPEC.md` and the schema doc (only the day-rate basis is documented as
  location-varying), but this is a documentation-based finding, not confirmed against the client's
  actual current practice. If real-world practice contradicts it, `PayrollEntryWorkLine`'s design
  (§12a) needs revisiting before Phase 3 schema work, since it currently assumes a single `grossPay`
  scalar per employee per cycle regardless of how many units they worked.
- **Assumption**: no one has manually altered the database, `.env`, or any untracked local file
  outside of what's described here since the last commit.
